# Laws of Checkers (English Draughts)

**Effective Date: September 14, 2025**

## PREAMBLE

These Laws of Checkers constitute a comprehensive codification of the rules governing the movement, capture, and interaction of pieces in the game historically known as English Draughts, American Checkers, or Straight Checkers. Every conceivable game situation arising from the interaction of pieces upon the sixty‑four squares of the checkerboard shall be governed by the articles herein. Where tournament practice clarifies procedure (e.g., touch‑move, illegal‑move remedies, use of clocks), these Laws note the standard approach.

---

## PART I: THE BOARD AND ITS SACRED GEOMETRY

### Article 1: The Nature of the Playing Surface

**1.1** The checkerboard consists of sixty‑four (64) squares arranged in an eight‑by‑eight (8×8) grid formation, wherein said squares alternate in color between light and dark.

**1.2** The dark squares, numbering thirty‑two (32) in total, constitute the sole playing surface upon which all pieces may exist and move. The light squares, also numbering thirty‑two (32), are completely inert and serve no function beyond visual demarcation.

**1.3** The board shall be oriented such that each player has a dark square on their immediate left corner (the “single corner”) and a light square on their immediate right corner; correspondingly, the near‑right flank is known as the “double‑corner” side.

**1.4** The dark squares shall be numbered 1 through 32 according to this immutable scheme (standard numeric notation):

* Squares 1–4: the first rank (nearest one player’s side)
* Squares 5–8: the second rank
* Squares 9–12: the third rank
* Squares 13–16: the fourth rank
* Squares 17–20: the fifth rank
* Squares 21–24: the sixth rank
* Squares 25–28: the seventh rank
* Squares 29–32: the eighth rank (nearest the opposing player)

Numbering begins at the leftmost dark square of the side to move first (that side’s single corner), proceeds left‑to‑right across each rank, and then rank by rank toward the opponent.

**1.5** Each dark square possesses exactly two (2), three (3), or four (4) diagonally adjacent dark squares, depending on its position within the matrix.

**1.6** Terminology used herein:

* **King row / crown‑head**: the opponent’s back rank (squares 29–32 for the side that starts; squares 1–4 for the opponent).
* **Single corner**: the lone dark corner square on a player’s left.
* **Double corner**: the pair of adjacent dark corner squares on a player’s right.

### Article 2: The Nature and Enumeration of Pieces

**2.1** Each player begins with exactly twelve (12) pieces of uniform type but distinguished by color.

**2.2** These pieces exist in two states:
a. **Uncrowned pieces** (also “men” or “singles”): the initial state of all pieces
b. **Crowned pieces** (also “kings”): the promoted state achieved through specific board traversal

**2.3** The transformation from uncrowned to crowned state is irreversible within the scope of a single game.

---

## PART II: INITIAL DEPLOYMENT

### Article 3: The Opening Position

**3.1** The player controlling the darker pieces (often Red/Black) shall place their twelve (12) pieces upon squares 1 through 12.

**3.2** The player controlling the lighter pieces (White) shall place their twelve (12) pieces upon squares 21 through 32.

**3.3** Squares 13 through 20 shall remain unoccupied at game commencement.

**3.4** The player with the dark pieces makes the first move.

---

## PART III: THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF MOVEMENT

### Article 4: Movement of Uncrowned Pieces

**4.1** An uncrowned piece may move exactly one (1) diagonal square forward from its current position to an unoccupied dark square.

**4.2** “Forward” is defined as movement toward the opponent’s back rank (squares 29–32 for the side moving first; squares 1–4 for the opponent).

**4.3** An uncrowned piece possesses at most two (2) possible non‑capturing moves from any given position, and at minimum zero (0) when blocked.

**4.4** Backward movement is prohibited for uncrowned pieces under all non‑capturing circumstances.

**4.5** Lateral movement along ranks is impossible due to the diagonal nature of all legal moves.

### Article 5: Movement of Crowned Pieces (Kings)

**5.1** A crowned piece may move exactly one (1) diagonal square in any of the four diagonal directions from its current position to an unoccupied dark square.

**5.2** The four directions are:
a. Forward‑left diagonal
b. Forward‑right diagonal
c. Backward‑left diagonal
d. Backward‑right diagonal

**5.3** A crowned piece possesses at most four (4) possible non‑capturing moves from any given position, and at minimum zero (0) when blocked.

**5.4** The crowned piece does not possess the ability to move multiple squares in a single non‑capturing move.

---

## PART IV: THE LAWS OF CAPTURE

### Article 6: The Fundamental Capture Mechanism

**6.1** A capture is executed by jumping over an opponent’s piece to land on the vacant square immediately beyond it in a straight diagonal line.

**6.2** The capturing piece must:
a. Be diagonally adjacent to the opponent’s piece
b. Have an empty square immediately beyond the opponent’s piece in the same diagonal line
c. Complete the jump in a single motion

**6.3** In a single‑jump capture (no further capture available from the landing square), the captured piece is removed upon completion of that jump. In a multiple‑capture sequence, all captured pieces are removed after the entire sequence is completed.

### Article 7: Capture by Uncrowned Pieces

**7.1** An uncrowned piece may capture by jumping diagonally forward over an adjacent opponent’s piece.

**7.2** An uncrowned piece may not capture by jumping diagonally backward.

**7.3** The restriction on backward capture applies even during multiple capture sequences.

### Article 8: Capture by Crowned Pieces

**8.1** A crowned piece may capture by jumping diagonally in any direction over an adjacent opponent’s piece.

**8.2** The omnidirectional capture ability includes:
a. Forward‑left diagonal capture
b. Forward‑right diagonal capture
c. Backward‑left diagonal capture
d. Backward‑right diagonal capture

### Article 9: The Mandatory Capture Rule

**9.1** When one or more captures are available to a player, that player must execute a capture. Non‑capturing moves are illegal when captures exist.

**9.2** The compulsory nature of captures supersedes all strategic considerations.

**9.3** Failure to execute an available capture constitutes an illegal move.

### Article 10: Multiple Captures

**10.1** When, after completing a capture, the capturing piece can immediately capture another opponent’s piece, it must continue capturing.

**10.2** A multiple capture sequence continues until:
a. No further captures are possible from the piece’s position; or
b. The piece reaches a square from which no opponent’s pieces can be captured.

**10.3** During a multiple capture sequence:
a. The capturing piece may change diagonal directions between successive jumps
b. Uncrowned pieces remain restricted to forward captures only
c. Crowned pieces may capture in any diagonal direction

**10.4** All captured pieces remain on the board until the entire capture sequence is completed, then are removed simultaneously.

**10.5** A piece may not jump over the same enemy piece more than once in a single sequence (captured pieces on the board act as impassable obstacles during the sequence).

### Article 11: Choice Among Captures

**11.1** When multiple different capture sequences are available, the player may choose which sequence to execute.

**11.2** The player is not required to make the sequence that captures the maximum number of opponent pieces.

**11.3** Once a capture sequence is initiated, it must be carried to completion as defined in Article 10.

---

## PART V: PROMOTION

### Article 12: The Mechanics of Crowning

**12.1** When an uncrowned piece reaches any square on the opponent’s back rank (the king row or crown‑head), it is immediately promoted to a crowned piece.

**12.2** For the side that started (dark pieces): the crown‑head consists of squares 29–32.

**12.3** For the opponent (light pieces): the crown‑head consists of squares 1–4.

**12.4** Promotion is:
a. Mandatory (not optional)
b. Immediate (occurs the instant the piece reaches the crown‑head)
c. Permanent (the piece remains crowned for the remainder of the game)

**12.5** In tournament practice, either player may place a second like‑colored checker atop the promoting piece to signify the crown.

### Article 13: Promotion During Capture

**13.1** If an uncrowned piece reaches the crown‑head via a capture, it is immediately crowned.

**13.2** The newly crowned piece may not continue capturing in the same turn, even if further captures are available from its landing square.

**13.3** The turn ends immediately upon such promotion during a capture sequence.

**13.4** This is the sole exception to mandatory continuation of multiple captures.

---

## PART VI: TERMINAL CONDITIONS

### Article 14: Victory by Elimination

**14.1** A player achieves victory when all of the opponent’s pieces have been captured and removed from the board.

**14.2** The game ends immediately upon the capture of the final opponent piece.

### Article 15: Victory by Immobilization

**15.1** A player achieves victory when the opponent, having pieces remaining on the board, possesses no legal moves on their turn (i.e., the winner made the last legal move).

**15.2** Immobilization occurs when:
a. All of the opponent’s pieces are blocked by the player’s pieces;
b. All of the opponent’s pieces are blocked by the edges of the board; or
c. A combination of blocking and edge constraints prevents all movement.

**15.3** This condition is distinct from stalemate in chess; the immobilized player loses.

### Article 16: Draw Conditions

**16.1** The game is drawn when:
a. Both players agree to a draw; or
b. A player demonstrates that with their next move the same position would occur for the third time in the game (with the same player to move); or
c. The Forty‑Move Rule (Article 17) is properly claimed.

**16.2** There is no automatic “insufficient material” draw in English Draughts. Endings that are practically drawn are formally concluded via agreement, threefold position, or the Forty‑Move Rule.

### Article 17: The Forty‑Move Rule

**17.1** A draw may be claimed if, during each player’s own previous forty (40) moves, there has been no capture and no movement of an uncrowned man.

**17.2** For this Article, “a move” means a move by one player (not a combined pair of moves).

**17.3** The count resets immediately upon any capture or any forward move by an uncrowned man.

---

## PART VII: GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS

### Article 18: Board Boundaries

**18.1** No piece may move beyond the confines of the sixty‑four‑square board.

**18.2** No piece may move to or through a light square under any circumstances.

**18.3** No two pieces may occupy the same square simultaneously.

### Article 19: Diagonal Integrity

**19.1** All movement and capture occur along exact diagonal lines.

**19.2** A diagonal line consists of squares that share corners but not edges.

**19.3** The board contains:
a. Fifteen (15) diagonals in each of the two diagonal orientations;
b. Two (2) main board diagonals of eight squares each (only one of which consists of dark squares);
c. Diagonals ranging from 1 to 8 squares in length.

### Article 20: Capture Geometry

**20.1** The capturing piece, the captured piece, and the landing square must lie in a straight diagonal line.

**20.2** The distance between the capturing piece’s origin and destination in a single jump is exactly two (2) diagonal squares.

**20.3** The captured piece occupies the intermediate square between origin and destination.

---

## PART VIII: TEMPORAL SEQUENCING

### Article 21: Turn Order

**21.1** Players alternate turns throughout the game without exception.

**21.2** A turn consists of either:
a. A single non‑capturing move; or
b. A complete capture sequence (which may involve multiple captures).

**21.3** A player may not pass their turn; a legal move must be made if one exists.

### Article 22: Move Completion

**22.1** A move is considered complete when:
a. The player’s hand releases the piece on its destination square (for positions not using clocks); or
b. When clocks are in use, after the player has made the move and pressed their clock.

**22.2** Once completed, a move cannot be retracted except to correct an illegal move as provided in Part IX.

---

## PART IX: SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Article 23: Huffing (Historical Rule — Deprecated)

**23.1** In historical play, failure to capture when required resulted in the opponent’s right to remove the offending piece (“huffing”).

**23.2** Modern rules treat failure to capture as an illegal move requiring correction; there is no forfeiture of a piece by huffing.

### Article 24: Touch‑Move Protocol

**24.1** On one’s turn, touching any piece without first announcing an adjustment obliges the player to play that piece:
• If it is their own piece, they must move it if legally playable;
• If it is an opponent’s piece, they must capture that piece if they have any legal capture upon it;
• If the touched piece cannot be legally played (moved or captured as applicable), the touch constitutes an illegal action subject to Article 25.

**24.2** Announcing “adjust” (or equivalent) before straightening a piece exempts the player from the obligations of 24.1.

**24.3** If any part of a playable piece is moved over a corner of its square, the move must be completed in that direction.

### Article 25: Illegal‑Move Remedies and Penalties

**25.1** On a first false, improper, or illegal move in a game, the player is cautioned and the move is recalled and corrected; a subsequent illegal move in the same game results in loss of the game. Examples of illegalities include (non‑exhaustive):
a. Omitting a mandatory capture or failing to complete a multi‑jump;
b. Touching an unplayable piece on one’s turn (per 24.1);
c. Moving to a wrong square;
d. Moving an uncrowned man backward;
e. Removing pieces that could not be captured by the move;
f. Continuing a capture through the king row with an uncrowned man;
g. Moving when it is not one’s turn.

**25.2** An illegal move is condoned if the opponent makes a move in reply; once condoned, play continues from the resulting position.

---

## PART X: THEORETICAL MAXIMA

### Article 26: Positional and Move Limits

**26.1** The maximum number of pieces on the board is twenty‑four (24). The maximum number of crowned pieces per player is twelve (12).

**26.2** From any given position, an uncrowned piece has:
• Maximum 2 non‑capturing moves;
• Maximum 2 initial capturing directions (forward‑left or forward‑right), subject to geometry and vacancies.

**26.3** From any given position, a crowned piece has:
• Maximum 4 non‑capturing moves;
• Up to 4 distinct capturing directions initially (subject to adjacency and vacant landing squares).

**26.4** The maximum number of enemy pieces that can be captured by one piece in a single legal move on the 8×8 English‑draughts board is finite and depends on arrangement. Known constructive examples achieve nine captures by a king; no numeric ceiling is set by these Laws. This clause is descriptive, not normative.

**26.5** While the theoretical total number of moves in a game is unbounded in principle (kings can shuttle), practical tournament play is limited by the Forty‑Move Rule (Article 17).

---

## PART XI: NOTATION AND RECORDING

### Article 27: Recording Moves

**27.1** The standard move‑recording method numbers the playable dark squares 1–32 (Article 1.4). A non‑capturing move is recorded “from–to” (e.g., 9‑14); a capture is recorded “from×to” (e.g., 22×15).

**27.2** In tournaments requiring score sheets, each player records their own moves legibly; at game end both players sign the final result.

---

## PART XII: OPENING METHODS AND FIRST MOVE

### Article 28: Opening Methods

**28.1** Standard play is “Go‑As‑You‑Please” (GAYP), with the dark side moving first (Article 3.4).

**28.2** Many events employ three‑move ballot openings: a preselected three‑move sequence is assigned, after which play proceeds normally. This is a tournament option and does not alter movement or capture laws.

---

## PART XIII: CLOCKS AND TIME CONTROLS

### Article 29: Clocks

**29.1** When clocks are used, a move is not complete until the player has pressed their clock. Failure to reach the specified time control results in loss on time.
